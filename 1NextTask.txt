LOOK:
look for weak points in my site. for example to update user information, if the user hasn't updated any information and - try to submit the form, the request is sent to server for update even if the user hasn't added any extra information. - This might effect site's performance as hackers can send many fake requests.

i have a ton of listings to display. i am showing each listing card having an image tag and other details now i am displaying 1 image of each listing here in home page but since i am fetching the whole listing, i am fetching all the images of listings from the server. the question is should i make a separate route in backend to fetch only 1 listing image here for home page. will it improve the site performance. right now i have 1 route to fetch listing as i am using same route to fetch listings of home page and on listing page where i am showing specific listing having all images as image slider. so should i make a separate route for fetching listing for home page and for listing page.

also i am fetching image and displaying it as image. is there any way to show only the preview of the image which might reduce the load time to fetch data.
