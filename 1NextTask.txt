Optimize your filter logic using debouncing, useMemo, and pagination for large datasets. (Need to know what are these...)

optimize site data fetching methods and displaying techniques like fetching preview of image instead of whole listing image and displaying. 

pagination == data on several pages only fetches the data when user go on to the required page.
async logging ==
caching data == (tool == redis)
payload compression. shrink data size before sending and recieving. (tool == gzip)
connection pool == avoid the overhead of opening and closing db connections. connection pool keeps these connections ready to go.

fixing responsiveness of image sliders for listing
cannot delete user through profile page button.
validation error: services must be an array when sending single service.
need to learn more about promises and Promise.all().

cannot delete all image previews. also when updating listing, if i select a new image, all other images will be removed and maybe the images in the database updates as intended or not.

cannot delete all image previews.

when i signup with google, the data of user is saved in mongodb but it does not save in redux state. i have to relogin - to get that data in my state.

LOOK:
look for weak points in my site. for example to update user information, if the user hasn't updated any information and - try to submit the form, the request is sent to server for update even if the user hasn't added any extra information. - This might effect site's performance as hackers can send many fake requests.
